            <p class=" info">The series is set in the fictional Kingdom of Dholakpur, somewhere in rural India. The series revolves around Bheem, sometimes referred to as Chhota Bheem due to his young age, a nine-year-old boy who is brave, strong and intelligent.[2] Bheem's rival is Kalia, who is envious of Bheem's popularity. Kalia, along with his sidekicks, twin brothers Dholu and Bholu, always plot to embarrass and defeat Bheem, but never succeed.</p>
